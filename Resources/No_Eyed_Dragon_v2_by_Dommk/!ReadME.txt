---No Eyed Dragon V2 - 3D-Model---


\\This model is made by Dominic Kett (Dommk / BlackSonicShadow)//


It's free to use, but keep in mind that if you use it in any kind (games, render, films,...) you
shall credit the author (in this case myself).
The textures for the model are included and should be easily accessable by any type of program.
You can get the original poly version on my cgtrader account (keep in mind that its almost not-optimized though)

>File formats: OBJ, MTL, FBX, DAE, PNG, JPG, TGA

Have fun using this model :3
